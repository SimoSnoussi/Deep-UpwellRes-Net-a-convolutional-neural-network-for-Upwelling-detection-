# U-Net based model for Upwelling segmentation in Sea Surface Temperature (SST) satellite images
This is a Keras based implementation of a U-Net like architecture to perform Upwelling region extraction in SST images.

# Implementation 
* Deep U-Net architecture is used to perform segmentation 
* The dataset consists of satellite-derived Sea Surface Temperature images provided by MODIS Terra satellite and can found in http://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/

# Network architecture
